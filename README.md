**Overview**  
This is an app that **sends the analysis result** of the match to the personal message app of the football team I belong to.

<br>
## Description
This app was written in Ruby.<br>I chose Ruby on Rails as framework.<br>
Team members will automatically receive the analysis results as a message on their smartphones after the analysis results are available.<br>
This app can be used on **LINE (messaging app)**. So you don't need to open the web app and **it's easy to use**.<br>

## Notable Point
Used the LINE API (message app)<br>
